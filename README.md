# My Website

This project is a React application set up with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, and AOS (Animate On Scroll) for animations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   cd my-website
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

npm start
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized build in the `build` directory.

### Usage
